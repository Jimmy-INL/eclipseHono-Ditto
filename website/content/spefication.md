##**Features**

The real-time data acquisition by sensors distributed inside the department makes it possible to inform users about the state of the department.
Through a web dashboard, it will be possible to visualize the energy consumption in the department and with the mobile application, it will be possible to obtain information about the occupation of the rooms.
The user will also have access to a notification system with air quality alerts in classrooms. The proposed work will enable several smart optimizations.
For example, by monitoring the energy consumption of the department it may be possible to optimize this value, by controlling the heating system based on the roomâ€™s allocation.
