##**Personas**

### Student and Developer

- **Name**: Sérgio Gonçalves
- **Age**: 26 year old
- **Occupation**: Student 

Sérgio Gonçalves is a 26 year old portuguese student. He lives with his parents and younger brother in an apartment near the University, where he studies Informatics.
In his free time he enjoys playing videogames on his PC at home and he often likes starting new projects to help him learn new programming concepts.
For his Mobile Computing class he has to make a mobile app that integrates an API to display information to its users.
He is interested in building this app centered around DETI so he needs an API that displays information about the department. Sérgio also has group projects from other classes and he likes to meet with his team so they can discuss ideas and improve their work.
In order to find an empty room for their meeting he would like to have a way to see which rooms are empty or, for example, if the Maker Lab doesn't have many people so they can focus on their work.

### Teacher

- **Name**: João Silva 
- **Age**: 50 year old
- **Occupation**: Teacher 

João Silva is a 50 year old Network Architecture professor at the Aveiro University.
When he is teaching large classes he notices that the air in the room often gets unpleasant due to all the breathing so he would like a way to be notified before it reaches that point so that he can take measures to improve the air quality, such as opening a window.
