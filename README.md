# DETImotic (server) 

## Introduction

DETImotic is a project about domotics and IoT.
The main goal is to improve the usage of DETI's infrastructure and equipment.
We intend to achieve this by designing the IoT ecosystem for DETI and providing useful documentation for future development.

In practice, this implies installing a sensor infrastructure and developing an API that provides access to the generated data. 
Additionally, we'll be making a system with a set of simple use cases to exemplify possible applications.
